# 02-passwordGenerator
Week 3 Homework

## Introduction
A fully-functional Password Generator, capable of randomizing lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols, or any chosen combination of them. Password length is restricted to remain between 8 and 128 characters. A copy button is also implemented, so users can quickly take their new random password and apply it where needed.

## Features
Instead of using prompts and alerts, which this assignment called for, I decided to challenge myself and use text input boxes and checkboxes instead.

- Text box to type in password length
- Check boxes to select what type of characters user would like in the random password
- Limitation prompt on how many characters are required for password length
- ReadOnly password generating text field
- Copy Password button
- Script written to ensure at least one character from each selected checkbox appears in the generated password
